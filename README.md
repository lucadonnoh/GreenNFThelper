# Green NFT Helper

Green NFT Helper is the companion website for our main submission, [Green NFTs: A Study on the Environmental Impact of Cryptoart Technologies](https://github.com/lucadonnoh/GreenNFT). You can find the main page of our website [here](https://lucadonnoh.github.io/GreenNFThelper).

# Motivation

While working on our paper for the GreenNFT Awareness Bounty, we came to a strikingly simple conclusion: the single, most effective on-chain way to reduce emissions is to reduce transaction fees. Compared to standard prices, a reasonably lower price can reduce a user's impact by up to 80%, far more than the benefits that optimizing NFT contracts can bring. Some users, however, are afraid of using lower prices, believing that even a few Gwei below the suggested values could exponentially increase waiting times or prevent confirmation altogether. We therefore use hourly gas price data and the model that we developed for the Awareness Bounty to help users reduce their emissions.
